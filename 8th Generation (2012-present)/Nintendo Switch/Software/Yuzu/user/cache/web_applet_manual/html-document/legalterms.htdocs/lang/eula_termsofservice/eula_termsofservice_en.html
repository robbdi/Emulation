PROTECTIONS: The Software may include measures to control access to the

updates and patches. Licensor may limit, suspend, or terminate the license
granted hereunder and access to the Software, including, but not limited to,
any related services and products, on thirty days’ notice, or immediately for
any reason beyond the Company’s reasonable control or if you breach any term of
an agreement or policy governing the Software, including this Agreement,
Licensor's Privacy Policy and/or Licensor's Terms of Service.</span></p>

CREATED CONTENT: The Software may allow you to create content, including, but

maintain a valid and active user account with an online service, such as a
third-party gaming platform or social network account (&quot;Third-Party
Account&quot;), or an account with Licensor or a Licensor affiliate, as set

<p class=MsoPlainText><span lang=EN-US style='font-family:"Century Gothic",sans-serif'>VIRTUAL
CURRENCY AND VIRTUAL GOODS</span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span lang=EN-US style='font-family:"Century Gothic",sans-serif'>If
the Software allows you to purchase and/or earn through play a license to use
Virtual Currency and Virtual Goods, the following additional terms and
conditions apply.</span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span lang=EN-US style='font-family:"Century Gothic",sans-serif'>VIRTUAL
CURRENCY &amp; VIRTUAL GOODS : The Software may enable users to (i) use
fictional virtual currency as a medium of exchange exclusively within the
Software (&quot;Virtual Currency&quot; or &quot;VC&quot;) and (ii) gain access
to (and certain limited rights to use) virtual goods within the Software
(&quot;Virtual Goods&quot; or &quot;VG&quot;). Regardless of the terminology used,
VC and VG represent a limited license right governed by this Agreement. Subject
to the terms of and compliance with this Agreement, Licensor hereby grants you
the nonexclusive, non-transferable, non-sublicensable, limited right and
license to use VC and VG obtained by you for your personal, non-commercial
gameplay exclusively within the Software. Except as otherwise prohibited by
applicable law, VC and VG obtained by you are licensed to you, and you hereby
acknowledge that no title or ownership in or to VC and VG is being transferred
or assigned hereunder. This Agreement should not be construed as a sale of any
rights in VC and VG.</span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span lang=EN-US style='font-family:"Century Gothic",sans-serif'>VC
and VG do not have an equivalent value in real currency and do not act as a
substitute for real currency. You acknowledge and agree that Licensor may
revise or take action that impacts the perceived value of or purchase price for
any VC and/or VG at any time except as prohibited by applicable law. VC and VG
do not incur fees for non-use; provided, however, that the license granted
hereunder to VC and VG will terminate in accordance with the terms and
conditions of this Agreement and the Software documentation, when Licensor
ceases providing the Software, or this Agreement is otherwise terminated.
Licensor, in its sole discretion, reserves the right to charge fees for the
right to access or use VC or VG and/or may distribute VC or VG with or without
charge.</span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span lang=EN-US style='font-family:"Century Gothic",sans-serif'>EARNING
&amp; PURCHASING VIRTUAL CURRENCY &amp; VIRTUAL GOODS: You may have the ability
to purchase VC or to earn VC from Licensor for the completion of certain
activities or accomplishments in the Software. For example, Licensor may
provide VC or VG upon the completion of an in-game activity, such as attaining
a new level, completing a task, or creating user content. Once obtained, VC
and/or VG will be credited to your User Account. You may purchase VC and VG
only within the Software, or through a platform, participating third-party
online store, application store, or other store authorized by Licensor (all
referred to herein as &quot;Software Store&quot;). Purchase and use of in-game
items or currency through a Software Store are subject to the Software Store's
governing documents, including but not limited to, the Terms of Service and
User Agreement. This online service has been sublicensed to you by the Software
Store. Licensor may offer discounts or promotions on the purchase of VC, and
such discounts and promotions may be modified or discontinued by Licensor at
any time without notice to you. Upon completing an authorized purchase of VC
from an Application Store, the amount of purchased VC will be credited to your
User Account. The Licensor shall establish a maximum amount you may spend to
purchase VC per transaction and/or per day, which may vary depending on the
associated Software. Licensor, in its sole discretion, may impose additional
limits on the amount of VC you may purchase or use, how you may use VC, and the
maximum balance of VC that may be credited to your User Account. You are solely
responsible for all VC purchases made through your User Account regardless of
whether or not authorized by you.</span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span lang=EN-US style='font-family:"Century Gothic",sans-serif'>BALANCE
CALCULATION: You can access and view your available VC and VG in your User
Account when logged into your User Account. Licensor reserves the right, in its
sole discretion, to make all calculations regarding the available VC and VG in
your User Account. Licensor further reserves the right, in its sole discretion,
to determine the amount of and manner in which VC is credited and debited from
your User Account in connection with your purchase of VG or for other purposes.
While Licensor strives to make all such calculations on a consistent and
reasonable basis, you hereby acknowledge and agree that Licensor's
determination of the available VC and VG in your User Account is final, unless
you can provide documentation to Licensor that such calculation was or is
intentionally incorrect.</span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span lang=EN-US style='font-family:"Century Gothic",sans-serif'>USING
VIRTUAL CURRENCY AND VIRTUAL GOODS: All purchased in-game Virtual Currency
and/or Virtual Goods may be consumed or lost by players in the course of
gameplay according to the game's rules applicable to currency and goods, which
may vary depending on the associated Software. VC and VG may only be used
within the Software, and Licensor, in its sole discretion, may limit use of VC
and/or VG to a single game. VC and/or VG may never be used in connection with
an agreement with other individuals to wager any money or other thing of value.
The authorized uses and purposes of VC and VG may change at any time. Your
available VC and/or VG as shown in your User Account will be reduced each time
you use VC and/or VG within the Software. The use of any VC and/or VG
constitutes a demand against and withdrawal from your available VC and/or VG in
your User Account. You must have sufficient available VC and/or VG in your User
Account in order to complete a transaction within the Software. VC and/or VG in
your User Account may be reduced without notice upon the occurrence of certain
events related to your use of the Software: For example, you may lose VC or VG
upon the loss of a game or the death of your character. You are responsible for
all uses of VC and/or VG made through your User Account, regardless of whether
or not authorized by you. You must notify Licensor immediately upon discovering
the unauthorized use of any VC and/or VG made through your User Account by
submitting a support request at www.take2games.com/support.</span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span lang=EN-US style='font-family:"Century Gothic",sans-serif'>NON-REDEEMABLE:
VC and VG may only be redeemed for in-game goods and services. You may not
sell, lease, license, or rent VC or VG, convert them into convertible VC. VC
and VG may only be redeemed for in-game goods or services and are not
redeemable for any sum of money or monetary value or other goods from Licensor
or any other person or entity at any time, except as expressly provided herein
or otherwise required by applicable law. VC and VG have no cash value, and
neither Licensor nor any other person or entity has any obligation to exchange
your VC or VG for anything of value, including, but not limited to, real
currency.</span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span lang=EN-US style='font-family:"Century Gothic",sans-serif'>NO
REFUND: All purchases of VC and VG are final and under no circumstances will
such purchases be refundable, transferable, or exchangeable. Except as
prohibited by applicable law, Licensor has the absolute right to manage,
regulate, control, modify, suspend, and/or eliminate such VC and/or VG as it
sees fit in its sole discretion, and Licensor shall have no liability to you or
anyone else for the exercise of such rights.</span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span lang=EN-US style='font-family:"Century Gothic",sans-serif'>NO
TRANSFERS: Any transferring, trading, selling, or exchanging of any VC or VG to
anyone, other than in game play using the Software as expressly authorized by
Licensor (&quot;Unauthorized Transactions&quot;), including, but not limited
to, among other users of the Software, is not sanctioned by Licensor and is
strictly forbidden. Licensor reserves the right, in its sole discretion, to
terminate, suspend, or modify your User Account and your VC and VG and
terminate this Agreement if you engage in, assist in, or request any
Unauthorized Transactions. All users who participate in such activities do so
at their own risk and hereby agree to be responsible and liable to Licensor,
its partners, licensors, affiliates, contractors, officers, directors,
employees, and agents for all damages, losses and expenses arising directly or
indirectly from such actions. You acknowledge that Licensor may request that
the applicable Application Store stop, suspend, terminate, discontinue, or
reverse any Unauthorized Transaction, regardless of when such Unauthorized
Transaction occurred (or has yet to occur) when it suspects or has evidence of
fraud, violations of this Agreement, violations of any applicable law or
regulation, or any intentional act designed to interfere or that otherwise has
the effect of or may have the effect of intervening in any way with the
operation of the Software. If we believe or have any reason to suspect that you
have engaged in an Unauthorized Transaction, you further agree that Licensor
may, in its sole discretion, restrict your access to your available VC and VG
in your User Account or terminate or suspend your User Account and your rights
to any VC, VG, and other items associated with your User Account.</span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span lang=EN-US style='font-family:"Century Gothic",sans-serif'>LOCATION:
VC is only available to customers in certain locations. You may not purchase or
use VC if you are not in an approved location.</span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span lang=EN-US style='font-family:"Century Gothic",sans-serif'>LIMITED
WARRANTY: Licensor warrants to you (if you are the initial and original
purchaser of the Software but not if you obtain the pre-recorded Software and
accompanying documentation as a transfer from the original purchaser) that the
original storage medium holding the Software is free from defects in material
and workmanship under normal use and service for 90 days from the date of
purchase. Licensor warrants to you that the Software is compatible with a
personal computer meeting the minimum system requirements listed in the
Software documentation or that it has been certified by the gaming unit
producer as compatible with the gaming unit for which it has been published.
However, due to variations in hardware, software, internet connections, and
individual usage, Licensor does not warrant the performance of the Software on
your specific computer or gaming unit. Licensor does not warrant against
interference with your enjoyment of the Software; that the Software will meet
your requirements; that operation of the Software will be uninterrupted or
error-free; or that the Software will be compatible with third-party software
or hardware or that any errors in the Software will be corrected. No oral or
written statement or advice provided by Licensor or any authorized
representative shall create a warranty. Because some jurisdictions do not allow
the exclusion of or limitations on implied warranties or the limitations on the
applicable statutory rights of a consumer, some or all of the above exclusions
and limitations may not apply to you.</span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span lang=EN-US style='font-family:"Century Gothic",sans-serif'>If
for any reason you find a defect in the storage medium or Software during the

discovered to be defective within the warranty period as long as the Software
is currently being manufactured by Licensor. If the Software is no longer
available, Licensor retains the right to substitute a similar piece of Software
of equal or greater value. This warranty is limited to the storage medium and
the Software as originally provided by Licensor and is not applicable to normal
wear and tear. This warranty shall not be applicable and shall be void if the
defect has arisen through abuse, mistreatment, or neglect. Any implied
warranties prescribed by statute are expressly limited to the 90-day period
described above.</span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span lang=EN-US style='font-family:"Century Gothic",sans-serif'>Except
as set forth above, and provided that if you are a resident of an EU member
state Licensor warrants that the Software will be fit for purpose and of
satisfactory quality, this warranty is in lieu of all other warranties, whether
oral or written, express or implied, including any other warranty of
merchantability, fitness for a particular purpose, or non-infringement, and no
other representations or warranties of any kind shall be binding on Licensor.</span></p>

INDIVIDUAL ARBITRATION - PLEASE READ THIS SECTION CAREFULLY. IT MAY
SIGNIFICANTLY ALTER YOUR RIGHTS, INCLUDING YOUR RIGHT TO FILE A LAWSUIT IN
COURT.</span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span lang=EN-US style='font-family:"Century Gothic",sans-serif'>1.    This
binding individual arbitration section will not apply to the extent prohibited
by the laws of your country of residence. </span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span lang=EN-US style='font-family:"Century Gothic",sans-serif'>2.    You
and the Company agree that should any dispute, claim, or controversy arise
between us regarding any Company products or services (hereafter a “Dispute”),
whether based in contract, statute, regulation, ordinance, tort (including
fraud, misrepresentation, fraudulent inducement, or negligence), or any other
legal or equitable theory, except for those matters listed in the Exclusions
From Arbitration paragraph below, and expressly including the validity,
enforceability, or scope of this ‘BINDING INDIVIDUAL ARBITRATION’ section (with
the exception of the enforceability of the Class Action Waiver clause below),
shall be submitted to binding arbitration, as described below, rather than
being resolved in court. The term “Dispute” is to be given the broadest
possible meaning that will be enforced and includes, for example, all matters
arising under this Agreement, the Privacy Policy, the Terms of Service, or any
other agreement with the Company. You understand that there is no judge or jury
in arbitration and that court review of an arbitration award is limited. </span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span lang=EN-US style='font-family:"Century Gothic",sans-serif'>3.    Exclusions
From Arbitration. You and the Company agree that any claim filed by You or the
Company in small claims court on an individual basis are not subject to the
arbitration terms contained in this Section. In addition, the Company or You
shall have the right to seek an injunction against you in court in order to
preserve the status quo while an arbitration proceeds.</span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span lang=EN-US style='font-family:"Century Gothic",sans-serif'>4.    Class
Action Waiver. THE ARBITRATION PROCEEDINGS DESCRIBED HEREIN WILL BE CONDUCTED
ON AN INDIVIDUAL BASIS ONLY. Neither You nor the Company shall be entitled to
join or consolidate disputes by or against other individuals or entities, or to
arbitrate any dispute in a representative capacity, including, without
limitation, as a representative member of a class or in a private attorney
general capacity, in connection with any Dispute. Further, unless both You and
the Company agree, the arbitrator may not consolidate more than one person’s
claim. The arbitrator may award any individual relief or individual remedies
that are permitted by applicable law, but to the maximum extent permitted by
applicable law, may not award relief against the Company respecting any person
other than You. </span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span lang=EN-US style='font-family:"Century Gothic",sans-serif'>5.    Right
to Opt Out of Binding Arbitration. IF YOU WISH TO OPT OUT OF THIS BINDING
INDIVIDUAL ARBITRATION REQUIREMENT, YOU MUST NOTIFY US IN WRITING WITHIN 30
DAYS OF THE DATE THAT YOU ACCEPT THIS AGREEMENT BUT ARE OPTING OUT OF BINDING
INDIVIDUAL ARBITRATION, UNLESS A LONGER PERIOD IS REQUIRED BY APPLICABLE LAW.
Your written notification must be mailed to TAKE TWO INTERACTIVE SOFTWARE,
LEGAL DEPARTMENT, ATTN: ARBITRATION OPT OUT, 110 West 44th Street, New York,
New York, 10036. Your notice must include (1) your full name; (2) your mailing
address; (3) your Social Club online ID, if you have one; and (4) a clear
statement that you do not wish to resolve disputes with the Company through
arbitration. You are responsible for ensuring the Company’s receipt of your
opt-out notice, and you therefore may wish to send a notice by means that
provide a written receipt. </span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span lang=EN-US style='font-family:"Century Gothic",sans-serif'>6.    Notice
of Dispute. If you have a Dispute with the Company, you must send written
notice to TAKE TWO INTERACTIVE SOFTWARE, LEGAL DEPARTMENT, ATTN: ARBITRATION OF
DISPUTE, 110 West 44th Street, New York, New York, 10036, in order to give the
Company the opportunity to resolve the dispute informally through negotiation.
Notice must be provided within two (2) years of the Dispute having arisen, but
in no event after the date on which the initiation of legal proceedings would
have been barred under the applicable statute of limitations. The failure to
provide timely notice shall bar all claims. If the Company has a dispute with
You, the Company will provide notice to the address it has on file for you, if
possible. You and the Company agree to negotiate the Dispute in good faith for
no less than 30 days after notice of the Dispute is provided. If the Dispute is
not resolved within 30 days after receipt of notice of the Dispute, the Company
or You may pursue the claim in arbitration as provided in this section. </span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span lang=EN-US style='font-family:"Century Gothic",sans-serif'>7.    Arbitration
Rules and Procedures. Arbitration shall be subject to the U.S. Federal
Arbitration Act and federal arbitration law, and shall be conducted by Judicial
Arbitration Mediation Services, Inc. (“JAMS”) pursuant to the JAMS Streamlined
Arbitration Rules and Procedures effective July 1, 2014 (the “JAMS Rules”), as
modified by this agreement to arbitrate. The JAMS Rules, including instructions
for initiating an arbitration, are available on its website at
http://www.jamsadr.com/rules-streamlined-arbitration. The Company will pay its
arbitration costs as required by the JAMS Rules and, in the event that you are
able to demonstrate that the costs of arbitration will be prohibitive as
compared to the costs of litigation, the Company will pay as much of your
arbitration filing and hearing fees as the arbitrator deems is necessary to
prevent the arbitration from being cost-prohibitive as compared to the cost of
litigation. Each side shall pay his, her, or its own attorneys’ fees and costs
unless the claim(s) at issue permit the prevailing party to be paid its fees
and/or litigation costs, in which case the arbitrator shall award fees or costs
as required by the applicable law.</span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span lang=EN-US style='font-family:"Century Gothic",sans-serif'>8.    Location
of Arbitration. At Your option, if an in-person hearing is required under the
JAMS Rules, the hearing will occur either in New York County, New York, or in
the United States county in which You reside.</span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span lang=EN-US style='font-family:"Century Gothic",sans-serif'>9.    Decision
of the Arbitrator. Any decision or award by the arbitrator shall be final and
binding on the parties. Unless otherwise agreed, any decision or award shall
set forth the factual and legal basis for the award. The arbitrator shall be
permitted to award only those remedies in law or equity which are requested by
the parties and which the arbitrator determines are supported by credible
relevant evidence. Any decision or award may be enforced as a final judgment by
any court of competent jurisdiction. If either party unsuccessfully challenges
the validity of an award, the unsuccessful party shall pay the opposing party’s
costs and attorneys’ fees associated with the challenge.</span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span lang=EN-US style='font-family:"Century Gothic",sans-serif'>10.  Continuation
in Effect. This Binding Individual Arbitration section survives any termination
of this Agreement or the provision of services to You by the Company.</span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span lang=EN-US style='font-family:"Century Gothic",sans-serif'>11.  Ability
to Change Terms and Conditions Inapplicable. Although the Company may revise
its End User License Agreement, Privacy Policy, Terms and Conditions, or other
agreements at its discretion, the Company does not have the right to alter this
agreement to arbitrate or the rules specified herein with respect to any
Dispute once that Dispute has accrued.</span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span lang=EN-US style='font-family:"Century Gothic",sans-serif'>12.  Severability.
If any part of this arbitration provision is deemed invalid, unenforceable, or
illegal, than the balance of this arbitration provision shall remain in effect
and be construed in accordance with its terms as if the invalid, unenforceable,
or illegal provision had not been included. The sole exception to this is the
class action waiver provision. If the prohibition on the arbitration proceeding
on a class basis is found to be invalid, unenforceable, or illegal, then the
entirety of this arbitration agreement shall be null and void and the Dispute
shall proceed in court under applicable class action rules and procedures. If,
for any reason, a claim proceeds in court rather than in arbitration, the
dispute shall be exclusively brought in state or federal court in New York
County, New York. Suits brought in state court may be removed to federal court
by either party if permissible by law.</span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span lang=EN-US style='font-family:"Century Gothic",sans-serif'>GOVERNING
LAW</span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span lang=EN-US style='font-family:"Century Gothic",sans-serif'>This
Agreement is entered into in the State of New York and shall be governed by,
and construed in accordance with, the laws of the State of New York, exclusive
of its choice of law rules. For any disputes not subject to binding individual
arbitration, you and the Company agree to submit to the exclusive jurisdiction
of the state and federal courts in New York County, New York, and to waive any
jurisdictional, venue, or inconvenient forum objections to such courts (but
without affecting either party’s rights to remove a case to federal court if
permissible). This paragraph will be interpreted as broadly as applicable law permits.
For example, , if you are a resident of a European Union member state, you will
benefit from any mandatory provisions of consumer protection law in the member
state in which you are resident, and you can bring legal proceedings in
relation to this Agreement in the courts of the member state in which you are
resident. You agree that any violation by You of this Agreement, the Privacy
Policy, the Terms of Service, or any other agreement with the Company, shall
constitute an affirmative defense (whether characterized as arising at law or
equity) against any claim you might assert against the Company relating to its
software or services. You and Licensor agree that the UN Convention on
Contracts for the International Sale of Goods (Vienna, 1980) shall not apply to
this Agreement or to any dispute or transaction arising out of this Agreement.
The Company has the right to prosecute civil claims against you for any
violation of its End User License Agreement, the Terms of Service, the Privacy
Policy, or any other governing terms and conditions related to its software and
services, whether for breach of contract, violation of common law rights, or
violation of any applicable state or federal statute. </span></p>
