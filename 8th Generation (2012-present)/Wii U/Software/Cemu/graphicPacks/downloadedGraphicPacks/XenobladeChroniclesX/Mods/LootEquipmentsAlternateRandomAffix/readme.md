# About the mod Alternate random augments

In vanilla, augments have a percent chance to be selected, some of them have 90 or 100%, while others have 10%.
This mod changes that: everything above 80% is capped at 80%, and everything else is set to 50%.
Example, table loot for "Ultra Diamond Spatha":

| Category  | Augment                   | Rate (%)  |
| --------- |:--------------------------| -----:|
| Stat      | Melee Accuracy Up         | 100 |
|           | Melee Attack Up           |  10 |
|           | Potential Boost           |   5 |
| Weapon Mod| Weapon Attack Power Up    |   3 |
|           | Melee: TP Gain Up         |   5 |
| Critical  | Critical Chance Up        |   5 |
|           | Theroid Criticals Up      |  10 |
|           | Insectoid Criticals Up    |  10 |
|           | Piscinoid Criticals Up    |  10 |
|           | Humanoid Criticals Up     |   8 |
|           | Mechanoid Criticals Up    |  10 |
| Attack    | Melee: Ether Res Down     |   3 |
|           | Soft Touch                | 100 |
| Art Mod   | Arts: Gain TP             |   8 |
| Special   | Crush: Gain TP            |   5 |
|           | Night Vision              |  10 |

In vanilla, 2 augments have 100% (Melee Accuracy Up and Soft Touch), which means you're guaranteed to always get **at least one of those two** on the loot. That doesn't let much space for the others augments...
Now with the mod, the table loot becomes:

| Category  | Augment                   | Rate (%)  |
| --------- |:--------------------------| -----:|
| Stat      | Melee Accuracy Up         | 80 |
|           | Melee Attack Up           | 20 |
|           | Potential Boost           | 20 |
| Weapon Mod| Weapon Attack Power Up    | 20 |
|           | Melee: TP Gain Up         | 20 |
| Critical  | Critical Chance Up        | 20 |
|           | Theroid Criticals Up      | 20 |
|           | Insectoid Criticals Up    | 20 |
|           | Piscinoid Criticals Up    | 20 |
|           | Humanoid Criticals Up     | 20 |
|           | Mechanoid Criticals Up    | 20 |
| Attack    | Melee: Ether Res Down     | 20 |
|           | Soft Touch                | 80 |
| Art Mod   | Arts: Gain TP             | 20 |
| Special   | Crush: Gain TP            | 20 |
|           | Night Vision              | 20 |

You now have a more random selection of augments. Of course, Melee Accuracy Up and Soft Touch will likely be selected more frequenly than the others, but this is not mandatory anymore, and all the others augments have an equal chance to appear.
